## About
There are programs or server environments that log a lot and may generate masses of log files. This is also the case with Nextcloud. Under certain circumstances, this can regularly lead to the hard drive running full, because the log file may be constantly fed with new errors.

It is not advisable to simply empty or delete the log file. The better approach is to look at the individual error entries and correct them so that they do not occur again.

That's where the LogCleaner app comes in. With LogCleaner it is possible to decide for yourself which error has to be processed or corrected or which error is irrelevant in order to inflate the log file. After correction or consideration, you can delete individual error entries from the log file with the help of LogCleaner. It doesn't matter whether the error is at the beginning, at the end or in the middle of the log file.

Furthermore LogCleaner can detect duplicates in the log file and delete them with just one click.
